# Automated Respiratory Condition Identification

Welcome to my research project repository on automated identification of respiratory conditions from annotated audio recordings using machine learning techniques.

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for our groundbreaking research, which aims to revolutionize the field of respiratory sound analysis. We explore state-of-the-art deep learning methodologies to develop highly accurate models capable of classifying respiratory conditions such as crackles and wheezes from audio recordings.

## Key Features

- **Ensemble Model**: Our research introduces an innovative ensemble model that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), and Transformers. This ensemble architecture leverages hierarchical feature extraction, temporal dependency modeling, and global pattern recognition to achieve superior classification performance.
- **Comprehensive Methodology**: Detailed documentation covers every aspect of our methodology, from data collection and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and interpretation. This ensures transparency, reproducibility, and scalability of our research.
- **Data Augmentation**: Various techniques, including time stretching and pitch shifting, are employed to augment dataset diversity and balance class representation. This helps prevent model bias and overfitting, leading to more robust and generalizable models.
- **Performance Evaluation**: We provide scripts for calculating performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Additionally, visualization tools are available to plot loss curves, accuracy trends, confusion matrices, and classification reports, facilitating comprehensive model assessment and interpretation.
- **Contribution to Healthcare**: By advancing automated respiratory sound analysis, our research has significant implications for healthcare technology. Our models promise to enhance diagnostic precision, leading to improved patient outcomes and enabling early intervention for respiratory conditions.
